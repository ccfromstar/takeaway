# Simple SAX-based XML2JSON Parser.

It does not parse the following elements: 

* CDATA sections (*)
* Processing instructions
* XML declarations
* Entity declarations
* Comments

## Installation
```
$ npm install xml2json
```

## Usage 
```javascript
var parser = require('xml2json');

var xml = "<foo>bar</foo>";
var json = parser.toJson(xml); //returns a string containing the JSON structure by default
console.log(json);
```
## API

```javascript
parser.toJson(xml, options);
```
```javascript
parser.toXml(json, options);
```

### Options object

Default values:
```javascript
var options = {
    object: false,
    reversible: false,
    coerce: true,
    sanitize: true,
    trim: true 
};
```

* **object:** Returns a Javascript object instead of a JSON string
* **reversible:** Makes the JSON reversible to XML (*)
* **coerce:** Makes type coercion. i.e.: numbers and booleans present in attributes and element values are converted from string to its correspondent data types.
* **trim:** Removes leading and trailing whitespaces as well as line terminators in element values.
* **sanitize:** Sanitizes the following characters present in element values:

```javascript
var chars =  {  
    '<': '&lt;',
    '>': '&gt;',
    '(': '&#40;',
    ')': '&#41;',
    '#': '&#35;',
    '&': '&amp;',
    '"': '&quot;',
    "'": '&apos;'
};
```




(*) xml2json tranforms CDATA content to JSON, but it doesn't generate a reversible structure.
